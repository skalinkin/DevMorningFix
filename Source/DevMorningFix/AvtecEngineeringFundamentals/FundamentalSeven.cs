Low-to-medium fan-out means having a given class use a low-to-medium number of other classes.High fan-out (more than about seven) indicates that a class uses a large number of other classes and may therefore be overly complex.Researchers have found that the principle of low fan-out is beneficial whether youâ€™re considering the number of routines called from within a routine or from within a class (Card and Glass 1990; Basili, Briand, and Melo 1996).";
